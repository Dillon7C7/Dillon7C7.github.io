				<h3>Home</h3>
				<p>	Welcome to my website. This is my first ever attempt at creating a website (from scratch). It may be quite basic, but I 
				have learned a lot by putting it together without relying on a template. I have used HTML to design it, CSS to style it, and 
				Javascript to switch tabs. I learned primarily through <a href="https://www.W3Schools.com"> W3Schools </a>. I hope to update this website more in the future. It is defiantly retro :^).</p>

				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I am a 25 year old male from Scarborough, Ontario. I have recently rekindled a childhood interest in technology and programming, and am feverishly working hard every day to refresh and improve my problem solving skills. My "end game" career goal is to become a software engineer. <br /><br />I was first exposed to programming as a child through the online RTS game Starcraft. The game allows the creation of custom maps that rely on programmable "triggers" (i.e. events) to create content. After making increasingly complex maps and becoming more and more involved in the Starcraft community, I was introduced to assembly language in the form of memory hacking. Learning how to create hacks was something that made me felt ecstatic: I'm sure I wasn't the only kid that was looking for game-enhancing cheats.<br /><br />After about a year, my school work was given first priority, and I gradually lost interest in programming in favor of more "typical" childhood interests. Over a decade later, I have once again resumed my programming advertures. I was initially looking for a nostalgic rush, but I have come to appreciate programming on a deeper level as a grown adult.</p>
